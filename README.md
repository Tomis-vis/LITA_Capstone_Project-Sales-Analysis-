###Project Title: Sales Data Analysis

###Project Overview:
This data analysis project aims to generate meaningful insights into sales products performance and their different regions. By examining various data parameters, we seek to gather valuable insights into customer preferences, market dynamics, and sales performance  which then help us know  and identify top performers from our data, tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gathered and then enable us to make a data driven decision that would fuel business productivity and growth.

### Cleaning and Data Preparation
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we carried out the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection. 
2. Handling missing variables. 
3. Data cleaning and formatting. 


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved the exploring of data to answer some questions about the data such as: 
- What is the total sales trend? 
- What is the average sales for each product? 
- What is the sales performance across different regions? 
- Which products are the top sellers?

---SQL 
I created a new database-LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT. I imported my data from Excel as a flat file to SQL this time! I didn't have to go through the stress of creating a table and inserting values into it...

`````````SQL

---Power BI 
I imported the same documwnt from Excel to power BI, transformed the data and loaded data. I worked on the Report View pane - created a table and reported visuals using Card, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart and Doughnut Chart respectively.
